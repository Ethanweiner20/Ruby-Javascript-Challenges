# Point Mutations

# PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: Two DNA strands, `strand1` and `strand2`
- **Output**: The Hamming distance between `strand1` and `strand2`
  - ie. The number of character differences
  - If unequal lengths => compute Hamming distance over shorter length
- **Hamming Distance**: The minimum # of point mutations that could have occurred on the evolutionary path between *two strands* (two ancestors)

*Implicit Requirements*:
- The strand strings themselves should *not* be mutated

*Edge Cases*:
- Empty string => No differences

*Questions*:


*Initial Ideas and Mental Models*:
- Parallel iteration: Iterate until either ends, compute # of times there's a difference
